This guide is perfect for you if:

* You're new to tech tools but curious about ways to understand how your computer systems work. Maybe you've heard about "observability" and want to see what it's all about, without getting lost in technical jargon.
* You're a software developer or work in IT, and while you're comfortable with computers, you're new to Odigos. You're looking for a clear, step-by-step guide that doesn't assume you're already an expert.
* You're simply interested in Odigos and want to give it a try. This guide will walk you through the process without assuming any prior knowledge.

Before installing Odigos, you need to set up some tools on your computer. These are one-time installations that prepare your computer for running Odigos.
You will only need to install these tools once on your computer. Next time you want to run the demo, you can skip this step and go directly to the next one.

   Please avoid using Docker Desktop built-in Kubernetes cluster as it [does not](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation) support bind propagation.
  </Warning>

    1. Install Homebrew

    Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software packages. We will use Homebrew to install Docker Desktop, KinD (Kubernetes in Docker), and the odigos CLI.

    a. Locate and open the Terminal application:

    - Click on the magnifying glass icon (üîç) in the top right corner of your screen.
    - Type "Terminal" into the search bar that appears.
    - Click on the Terminal application icon (it looks like a black box with a command prompt ">_").

    b. When the Terminal window opens, you'll see a prompt where you can type commands. It might look something like this:

    ```
    YourComputerName:~ YourUsername$
    ```

    c. Check if Homebrew is Installed

      ```
      brew --version
      ```

  If you see a version number being displayed, Homebrew is already installed and you can skip to the next step. If not, you will need to install Homebrew:


    d. Copy the following command (you can select it with your mouse and use Command+C to copy):

    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    e. Paste this command into the Terminal (use Command+V to paste) and press the `Enter` key.

    f. The Terminal will start showing some text as it runs the command. This is normal.

    g. At some point, you may be asked to enter your computer's password. When you type your password, you won't see any characters appear ‚Äì this is a security feature. Just type your password and press `Enter`.

    h. The installation may take several minutes. You'll know it's done when you see the command prompt again (like in step b).

    i. After the installation is complete, close the Terminal window by clicking the red circle in the top left corner.

    k. Open a new Terminal window (repeat step a) to ensure the installation takes effect.

    #### 2. Install Docker Desktop

    Docker Desktop creates a special environment on your computer where Odigos can run.

    a. In the new Terminal window, copy and paste the following command, then press `Enter`:

    ```
    brew install --cask docker
    ```

    b. Wait for the installation to complete. You'll know it's done when you see the command prompt again.

    c. Once the installation is complete, you need to open Docker Desktop:

    - Click on the magnifying glass icon (üîç) in the top right corner of your screen.
    - Type "Docker" into the search bar.
    - Click on the Docker application icon (it looks like a whale carrying boxes).

    d. When Docker starts for the first time, you may see a box asking for your computer's password. Enter your password and click `OK`.

    e. You may see a welcome screen or tutorial from Docker. You can close this or click through it.

    f. Wait until you see a green dot next to "Docker Desktop is running" in the Docker Dashboard.

    #### 3. Install KinD

    KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) helps set up a test environment for Odigos.

    a. Go back to your Terminal window (or open a new one if you closed it).

    b. Copy and paste the following command, then press `Enter`:

    ```
    brew install kind
    ```

    c. Wait for the installation to complete. You'll know it's done when you see the command prompt again.

    ### Installing Odigos

    #### 1. Set up a test environment

    a. In the Terminal, copy and paste the following command and press `Enter`:

    ```
    kind delete cluster --name odigos-demo
    ```

    This removes any existing test environment with the same name. If this is your first time, you'll see a message saying the cluster doesn't exist, which is fine.

    b. Now, copy and paste this command and press `Enter`:

    ```
    kind create cluster --name odigos-demo
    ```

    This creates a new test environment.

    c. You'll see a lot of text appear in the Terminal. This is normal. Wait until you see a message that says "Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!" and the command prompt appears again.

    #### 2. Install the Odigos CLI tool

    The Odigos CLI (Command Line Interface) tool allows you to manage Odigos from the Terminal.

    a. In the Terminal, copy and paste the following command and press `Enter`:

    ```
    brew install odigos-io/homebrew-odigos-cli/odigos
    ```

    b. Wait for the installation to complete. You'll know it's done when you see the command prompt again.

    #### 3. Install Odigos in your test environment

    a. In the Terminal, copy and paste the following command and press `Enter`:

    ```
    odigos install
    ```

    b. This step may take several minutes. You'll see a lot of text appear in the Terminal ‚Äì this is normal.

    c. You'll know it's done when you see a message saying "SUCCESS: Odigos installed." and the command prompt appears again.

    #### 4. Open the Odigos control panel

    a. In the Terminal, copy and paste the following command and press `Enter`:

    ```
    odigos ui
    ```

    After you run this command, the Terminal will look like it's frozen. This is normal ‚Äì it's running a program in the background.

    b. Open your web browser (like Safari or Chrome).

    c. In the address bar at the top of the browser window, type exactly this:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

    Then press `Enter`.

    d. The Odigos control panel should now open in your browser. It might take a few seconds to load.

    #### 5. Set up Odigos

    a. In the Odigos control panel, you'll see a page titled "Select Sources". Sources are the things Odigos can monitor.

    b. Click the checkbox next to each Source you want to monitor. If you're not sure, you can select all of them.

    c. Click the blue "Next" button at the bottom right of the page.

    d. You'll now see a page titled "Add Destinations". Destinations are places where Odigos can send its information.

    e. Click on one of the destination options (for example, "Jaeger").

    f. Fill in any required information. If you're not sure what to enter, consult the Odigos documentation or ask for help.

    g. Click the blue "Create Destination" button.

    h. You should now see an overview page showing your selected Sources and Destinations.

    Congratulations! You've now installed and set up Odigos on your Mac.
